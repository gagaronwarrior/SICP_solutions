complete sqrt programme:
------------------------
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (average (/ x guess) guess))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (good-enough?  guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (abs x)
  (if (< x 0)
      (- x)
      x))

(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
        

one important observation in average procedure is that if average is made on (x/guess) and x,
the series does not converge and infinite loop is seen.
